## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries.
- Flexbox
- CSS animations (transform & transition)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- use of the method "toogle" in javascript;
- The use of the background-position parameter, the possibility to use negative values to position elements outside the container and disable it with the value "unset"
I also strengthened my knowledge of:
- Display flex;
- absolute/relative position;
- use of z-index;
- Use of animations to give more life to the interactive elements of my pages.
- Manipulation of images in SVG format, mainly the "fill" attribute

### Continued development

In future challenges I would like to deepen and master the use of display flex/grid and consolidate my javascritp management in relation to cssy html

### Useful resources
